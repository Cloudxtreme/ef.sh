The `ef.sh` script is the actual tool I use to generate my personal website
at [joelkleier.com](http://joelkleier.com).

All the other files in this are example documents based off of my personal
site.

You'll need BASH, coreutils, and [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
installed if you'd like to play around with it.

If you're running ubuntu, it'd simply be:

    $ sudo apt-get install pandoc
    $ ./ef.sh

If you're running a unix, then you might need to fiddle with some of the `date`
commands used `ef.sh`.

Enjoy! or don't...
